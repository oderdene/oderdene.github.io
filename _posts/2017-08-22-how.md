The minimal-blog is really a minimal blog template and very easy to use. If you host your blog on GitHub, you can just fork 
[my repository](https://github.com/runningUnicorn/minimal-blog), after a few [setting steps]({% post_url 2017-08-21-how-github %}), 
your blog will come into alive on GitHub. 

This post helps you to get started:  
<br>
#### Change the basic information of your site
Jekyll saves configuration information in the file `_config.yml`. So just open this file with your favoiate text editor, change 
the title, tagline to your blog's. Of course, you can control other behaviors by changes attributesï¼Œ such as permalink, paginate.  
<br>
#### Create your first new post
In order to write a new post, you need to create files in the folder `_posts`. Files in Jekyll post folder should named according to 
the following convention:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-filename.md  
```
Where YYYY is a fout-digit year, MM and DD are two-digit month and day respectively.  
Every post file should start with the [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), which tells Jekyll which layout to use, what is 
the title of this post, the category, the tag and so on. For the minimal-blog template, it looks like:  
```

title: Use Minimal-blog  
category: Post

```

#### Add google Analytics or AdSense
Firstly, you should have a [google analytics account](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en) and create a new property for 
your new site. Then copy your tracking code into the file:
```
/_includes/google-analytics.html
```
That's it. Really easy.
For google Adsense, it is almost the same. The only difference is that your copy your [google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/) code 
into the file:
```
/_includes/google-adsense.html
```
<br>
#### Change the link list to other websites
In the sidebar, your will find a link section, where there are some links to other website. If you want to modify the list, go to file '/data/links.yml', 
add a item like:
```
- title: Jekyll Template GitHub
  url: https://github.com/runningUnicorn/minimal-blog
```
Where title is the name showed in the list, url is the website address you want to link to.  
<br>
Have fun with Jekyll!
